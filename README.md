Dairo is an open-source application designed to bridge the gap between human intent and AI instruction. It takes your simple, everyday language and intelligently engineers it into a detailed, context-aware, and powerful prompt, ready to be used with any Large Language Model.

## About The Project

In a world powered by Large Language Models, the quality of your input dictates the quality of your output. However, most of us aren't expert prompt engineers. We know what we want, but we don't know how to ask for it effectively.

**Dairo solves this problem.**

It acts as your personal AI co-pilot, transforming basic prompts into masterfully crafted instructions. More importantly, Dairo doesn't just give you the answer; it shows you its work, explaining *why* the new prompt is better, helping you become a better prompter with every use.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Intelligent Prompt Engineering:** Leverages a powerful LLM via OpenRouter to rewrite and enrich your prompts.
*   **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Instantly see the difference between your original prompt and Dairo's engineered version.
*   **"Why" Explanations:** Get automated, clear explanations on what improvements were made (e.g., added persona, specified format, etc.).
*   **Local History:** Your past prompts are automatically saved to your browser's local storage for easy access.
*   **Agent System:** (Coming Soon) Use pre-defined agents like "Software Engineer" or "Marketing Expert" to tailor prompts for specific domains.
*   **LLM Playground:** (Coming Soon) Test your engineered prompts against various models directly within the app.
